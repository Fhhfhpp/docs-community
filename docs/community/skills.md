# Skills and ways to contribute

## Where to start?

The short answer to this question is: follow your interests :-)

The [Python Developer's Guide documentation](https://devguide.python.org/documentation) section is a good place to start.
It's a comprehensive guide to the Python documentation and the tools we use to build it.
It's a good idea to read through the guide to get a sense of the tools and processes we use.

## A note on complexity of tasks

Depth/expertise required for certain kinds of tasks can be hard to nail down and not at
all obvious. If you'd like to make a contribution and you're not sure where to start,
a good rule of thumb is to reach out to another team member to help
you scope the work you'd like to do, and to set expectations.

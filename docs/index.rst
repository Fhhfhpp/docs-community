Why have this repo?
===================

This repository helps the Documentation Community set a monthly
course for project activity. Our overriding goal is continuous team and
project improvement.

As projects and their growth evolve rapidly, the contents of this repo
should aid us in setting project direction and adjusting the course as
needed. The repo contains:

- team meeting agendas and archives
- direction and action plans

Code of Conduct
===============

We adopt the PSF Code of Conduct (https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).
